*SimpleCovBadge* is a gem that can be added to the `Gemfile` and will produce a file called `coverage_badge.png` in the `coverage` directory.
It could be looking as follows dependent on how it is configured.

![Badge](https://marcgrimme.github.io/simplecov-small-badge/badges/coverage_badge_total.svg)

The idea is to created a badge for [SimpleCov](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov) to create a persistable image that shows the coverage in percent as a badge.

## Installation

The badge creation is dependent on the [Repo-small-badge gem](https://github.com/marcgrimme/repo-small-badge) which creates and SVG badge.
It can be installed in your Ruby library or rails app as part of the `Gemfile` as follows.

```
# In your gemfile
gem 'simplecov-small-badge', :require => false
```

This gem is an alternative and inspired by the great work in the other gem [simplecov-badge](https://github.com/matthew342/simplecov-badge) which does a similar badge but looks different and cannot easily made small. So it's mostly an optical alternative.

## Usage

Whereever you are integrating `SimpleCov` you can configure the `SimpleCovSmallBadge` gem as any formater can be configured. The default integration could looks as follows:

```ruby
require 'simplecov_small_badge'

# Wherever your SimpleCov.start block is (spec_helper.rb, test_helper.rb, or .simplecov)
SimpleCov.start do
  # add your normal SimpleCov configs
  add_filter "/app/model"
  # call SimpleCov::Formatter::BadgeFormatter after the normal HTMLFormatter
  SimpleCov.formatters = SimpleCov::Formatter::MultiFormatter.new([
    SimpleCov::Formatter::HTMLFormatter,
    SimpleCovSmallBadge::Formatter
  ])
end

# configure any options you want for SimpleCov::Formatter::BadgeFormatter
SimpleCovSmallBadge.configure do |config|
  # does not created rounded borders
  config.rounded_border = true
  # set the background for the title to darkgrey
  config.background = '#ffffcc'
end
```

## Integration into Travis-CI via github-pages

This process is split into two steps.

1. You need to create an access token for you github repository that can be configured to travis to allow password-less pushing. This is described in [Github Help - Authenticating to GitHub / Creating a personal access token for the command line](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/)

2. Configure travis to push the result to github-pages inspired from [the Travis description](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/pages/) and configuration to be found in [.travis.yml](.travis.yml)

3. Integrate your badge into the README.md as follows ``![Coverage](https://marcgrimme.github.io/simplecov-small-badge/badges/coverage_badge_total.png)``

## Configuration Options

The behaviour of `SimpleCovSmallBadge` can be influenced by configuration options as defined in the [configuration class](lib/simplecov_small_badge/configuration.rb).

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bundle update` to install dependencies. Then, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release` to create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
